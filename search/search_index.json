These documents attempt to describe the smart contract architecture of the project in words. We hope that any interested developer will read these documents to help understand the Mobius project's code structure and logic. The addresses of currently-deployed contract instances are available in the Addresses section. The deployment of contracts is managed by the Publisher section. Overview The Mobius system is composed of a number of core contract complexes, and several auxiliary contracts that enhance liquidity and general system functionality. These on-chain entities and how they communicate is reflected in the following high-level diagram. The Oracle, Mobius, Synths, Storage, and Reward elements comprise the core of the system. The Infrastructure contracts are supporting components which, help Mobius to better manage the core function and implement the system. Each of the elements in this graph may be a complex composed of several contracts, as described below. Some relatively unimportant links have been omitted, but more detailed descriptions are available at the documentation pages for each specific contract.
